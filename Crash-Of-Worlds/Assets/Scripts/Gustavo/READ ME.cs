    // to make it easier to edit my scripts, they should all only require minor tweaks to make them work,
    // all the scripts in the same location as this one are the ones you'll need to use. (Excluding the Player Movement, I just was using it to test easier)
    // If you have any questions regarding the scripts or having trouble with them, contact me on Discord "Tav".
    //  Btw if you require any reference to where the scripts go, look at my scene named "FromScratch"
